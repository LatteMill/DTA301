Here are some HTML scripts and JSON files generated by
an analytical software program developed at ACME to 
mine product reviews. 

The shown topics might look a little different 
compared to the book. This is because data was 
collected at different timestamps.

To view them, make sure you have the Internet connection,
and launch the HTML files in Firefox.
